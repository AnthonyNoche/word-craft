# NEED HELP 
I need help fixing the part of user_name_script.gd that handles uploading user data to the Firebase Realtime Database. The integration isn't working as expected, and I suspect there's an issue with how the database reference or write operation is set up.

Im not that good at coding this stuff :)

i removed the .env file for privacy reasons
